# DSP Primitives in C++

This repository contains some audio filtering algorithms I implemented in C++ for a lab in my DSP course.

### Lab Description

The purpose of this 3DY4 lab is to provide a link between the modeling of (DSP) primitives used in Software DeÔ¨Åned Radios (SDRs) in an interpreted and scripting language like Python to their implementation in C++. All the details are in the lab [document](doc/3dy4-lab2.pdf).

The start-up code is in the [src](src/) sub-folder.
